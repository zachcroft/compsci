# compsci
Codes for exploring concepts in computer science

## Sorting algorithms (compsci/sorting)

### bubble_sort.py

Iterate over elements in an array. If the current element's neighbor on the right is smaller, then swap them.

### selection_sort.py

Double loop over the array, placing the lowest remaining element into position.

## Search algorithms (compsci/search)

### binary_search.py
Locate the position of a specified element in a sorted array by iteratively dividing the list in half.
